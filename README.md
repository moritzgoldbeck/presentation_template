# LaTeX Presentation Template

This is my standard presentation template. It is produced for *academic presentations* using LaTeX and follows a *minimalistic design approach*. In particular, I tried to reduce all (in my view) unneccessary clutter and keep slides readable and straight-forward with a minimal number of design elements. The template structure follows the usual structure of presentations in applied micro-economics but can, of course, be adapted for other use cases.

Here are some sample slides: <a href="template_presentation.pdf">template_presentation.pdf</a>

Please feel free to use and share.
