# LaTeX Presentation Template

This is my standard presentation template. It is produced for *academic presentations* using LaTeX and follows a *minimalistic design approach*. In particular, I tried to reduce (in my view) all unneccessary clutter and keep slides readable and straight-forward with a minimal number of design elements.

Please feel free to use and share.
